## HTTP2 Server Push

- ‚úÖ Proactively send resources <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚ùå Caching got more complicated <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->

## Syntax

```
HTTP/1.1 103 Early Hints
Link: <https://example.com>; rel="preconnect"
Link: </style.css>; rel=preload; as=style
Link: </script.js>; rel=preload; as=script
```

Note: Goal today is to explain the concepts. Details on how to set this up are better served with docs and tutorials from Cloudflare and Fastly. If you're considering rolling your own, talk to some of those folks about the common pitfalls.

---

## Resource Hints Review

Early hints can be sent for <br/>
`preconnect` and `preload`.

---

```html
<!-- Preconnect -->
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdn.shopify.com">
```

Note: All modern browsers except Firefox

---

```html
<!-- Preload -->
<link
  href="//cdn.shopify.com/.../ShopifySans-Regular.woff2"
  rel="preload" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin="true">
```

Note: All modern browsers

# When to consider Early Hints <!-- .element: class="dark-background highlighter"-->

---

> When a buyer visits a Shopify website, if that **first page experience** is 10% faster, on average there is a 7% increase in conversion.

---

## Should I consider Early Hints?

- ‚úÖ First impressions are important for conversion (use on top landing pages) <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚úÖ Server has to do work before sending the HTML <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚ùå Server can immediately send the HTML <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚úÖ Server is farther from user than edge/CDN server <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚úÖ Traffic is high enough that the edge/CDN server will likely have Early Hints cached <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚úÖ Use on resources that do not change often <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->

Note: BFCM 2021 test. LCP improved across all regions and operating systems on Chrome browsers when an early hint was used to preconnect to our CDN domain. ~500ms improvement in median LCP

# ü§î

Note: take a step back and realize we wouldn't need this if we didn't have a separate CDN domain - so we're using EH to accommodate for a less-than-ideal situation due to legacy architecture. Under HTTP1, domain sharding was a better way to serve assets faster due to the limited number of concurrent connections ~6. Can't instantly switch each time a new HTTP version comes out.

---

## Preload

```
HTTP/1.1 103 Early Hints
Link: <font1.woff2>; rel=preload; as=font; crossorigin...
Link: <font3.woff2>; rel=preload; as=font; crossorigin...
Link: <script.js>; rel=preload; as=script; type=text/javascript
Link: <main.js>; rel=preload; as=script; type=text/javascript
Link: <theme.css>; rel=preload; as=style;
```

## Shopify themes use Liquid for templating

- HTML templating language
- Similar to Nunjucks, HAML, Handlebars, Pug, etc.
- Can access data directly in Liquid for SSR
- See layout (wrapper) [example](https://github.com/Shopify-Web-Perf-Team-Internal/perf-shopify-theme/blob/main/layout/theme.liquid) for context

---

## Early Hints via Liquid

```liquid
{{ 'font.woff2'
  | asset_url
  | preload_tag:
      as: 'font',
      type: 'font/woff2',
      crossorigin: true
}}

{{ 'script.js' | asset_url | preload_tag: as: 'script' }}

{{ 'style.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag: preload: true }}
```

Note: Liquid: piping into next filter, additional params after filter. Stores can only access EH using Liquid, and only to files on our CDN. Will create both preload tags and EH's.

---

```liquid
{{
  product.featured_image
    | image_url: width: 2 000
    | image_tag:
        preload: true,
        widths: 50, 80, 90, 100, 120, 160, 200, 300, 400, 500,
          600, 700, 800, 1000, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2000
}}
```

Note: Also an example of accessing data object directly in Liquid. Can anyone imagine what might go wrong here???

Note: Our preconnect tests were a true A/B test. But for preload, in true engineering style, we might have over optimized the laziness factor and tried to do a before/after test.

Note: So what we actually measured was a TTFB degradation unrelated to EH. Which leads me to the next part of the presentation...

## How I blew through my WebPageTest Pro budget in 2 days

---

## 1.2% improvement in p50 LCP

- 16 different merchant websites
- Index, collection, and product pages
- High variation within each 9 runs
- Ranged from -15% to 21%

Note:  Etsy recently conducted an experiment using early hints and measured a 2.5% improvement in LCP for landing pages, based on preconnects and font preloads. They are evaluating other ways of implementing to early hints to maximize the performance gains. Wix tested preconnects and haven't found significant improvement with it yet.

---

## Preload is still a footgun.
