# üìà Metrics üìà

> When optimizing for speed, <br>**user experience** should always <br>be your primary metric.

---

## User experience

1. When can I see the page? <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
2. When can I interact with it? <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
3. Is it delightful? <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

<small>[Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/), [The Science Behind Web Vitals](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/the-science-behind-web-vitals.html)</small>

Note: Target is 75% of loads. "Core Web Vitals are the subset of Web Vitals that apply to all web pages, should be measured by all site owners, and will be surfaced across all Google tools. Each of the Core Web Vitals represents a distinct facet of the user experience, is measurable in the field, and reflects the real-world experience of a critical user-centric outcome." Note modifications over time to improve.

## WEBP: Increased cross-browser availability

<img class="plain" src="./images/caniuse-webp.png" alt="caniuse page for webp showing not much safari support">

<small>[caniuse](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webp)</small>

Note: WEBP is a new format available on most modern browsers (I'm looking at you, Safari) that combines the best of JPG and PNG with smaller sizes. It's lossy or lossless and supports transparency.

---

## AVIF: The future

<small>[Equal file sizes demo](https://jakearchibald.com/2020/avif-has-landed/#at-equal-file-sizes) by Jake Archibald, [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/avif)</small>

## Cheatsheet

- ‚úÖ SVG: logos and icons <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚ùå GIF: don't. use jpg for a still or video for animation. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚úÖ PNG: photo-like images with transparency <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚úÖ JPG: photo-like images with no transparency <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚úÖ WEBP: smaller, but need to serve fallbacks <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚úÖ AVIF: EVEN SMALLER, but need to serve fallbacks <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->

<small>[Responsive Doggos Demo](https://projects.sia.codes/responsive-images-demo/)</small>

Note: Raster file formats are really just different compression methods. **SVG**: Can style and animate with CSS or make basic edits in XML. **GIF**: huge file sizes for animation, use video instead. svg or jpg are better for stills. Twitter converts GIF to video.  **PNG**: Use jpg if don't need transparency. **JPG**: much better compression algos.

Note: How many different resolutions? Science suggests humans can see 720ppi 1 foot from a screen. The iPhone 11 is 326ppi (MBP is 227) so in most cases, you're safe providing only 1x and 2x. You might consider 4x in cases of high-resolution projectors or art.

## Paid Services üí∞

For example, [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) supports AVIF, and you can optionally sign up for the beta to use it with `f_auto`.

```bash

```

## More tools created & more packaged into popular frameworks for DX

- Simple `<img>` and server/serverless function selects best image to serve
- Build tools and integrated frameworks (but `sizes` not always supported)
  - [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image)
  - [responsive-loader](https://github.com/herrstucki/responsive-loader)
  - [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/) and [gatsby-transformer-sharp](https://image-processing.gatsbyjs.org/)
  - [Eleventy image plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/)


Note: (1) Many people have their server hijack the request and serve the best image to minimize markup. Could also use a serverless function. (2) Cost money. (3) So many options - both create your srcset code and process the images

## 103 Early Hints

> 103s are served to clients while a 200 OK (or error) response is being prepared (the so-called ‚Äúserver think time‚Äù), and contain hints on which assets will likely be needed to fully render the web page.

<small>[Early Hints: How Cloudflare Can Improve Website Load Times by 30%](https://blog.cloudflare.com/early-hints/), [Chrome Status: Feature: 103 Early Hints for Navigation](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5207422375297024)</small>


Note: "the page load could have been accelerated had the browser known, prior to receiving the full response, that the stylesheet and the four subsequent scripts will be needed to render the page. Early Hints avoids these issues by ‚Äúhinting‚Äù (vs. push being dictatorial) to clients which assets they should load, allowing them to prioritize resource loads with more complete information about what they will likely need to render a page, what they have cached, and other heuristics."
