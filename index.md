## Raster vs Vector

<img src="./images/raster_vs_vector.png" alt="Raster vs Vector scaling" width="80%">

<small>https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bitmap_VS_SVG.svg</small>

Note: Raster images contain a set of data about a 2D grid of pixels. Vectors are a system of coordinates and "vectors" than can be redrawn at any size. Rasters are good for photo-realism. Raster file formats are really just different compression methods.

---

<svg version="1.1" width="300" height="200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="turquoise" /><circle cx="150" cy="100" r="80" fill="rebeccapurple" /><text x="150" y="125" font-size="60" text-anchor="middle" fill="white">SVG</text></svg>

```xml
<svg version="1.1"
     width="300" height="200"
     xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

  <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="turquoise" />
  <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="80" fill="rebeccapurple" />
  <text x="150" y="125" font-size="60"
        text-anchor="middle" fill="white">SVG</text>
</svg>
```

Note: (vector) - best for limited colors and sharp lines (e.g., logos)

---

## GIF

Just. Don't.

<video controls width="700" autoplay loop>
  <source src="./images/dont.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>

Note: (lossy) - fun but terrible. Use SVG or video instead. Inspect this (or on Twitter) and see that's it's video.

---

## PNG: photo-like images with transparency

<img class="plain" src="./images/harry.png" alt="cut out image of my dog with no/transparent background">

Note: (lossless) - best for photo-realistic with transparency. **Lossless compression** - like using ZIP for a file but all the data is still saved.

---

## JPG: photo-like images with no transparency

<img class="plain" src="./images/harry-garden.jpg" alt="photo of my dog in a garden" width=600px>

Note: JPG is your photo workhorse. It's a lossy format that was created to compress by hue - in a way that human eyes are less likely to detect, so it's smaller than PNG. Use for all:

---

## Progressive JPG

<img class="plain" width=600px src="./images/sleepy-purrito-baseline-timeline.jpeg" alt="cats rendering in a raster way">
<img class="plain" width=600px src="./images/sleepy-purrito-progressive-timeline.jpeg" alt="cats rendering from blurry to sharp">

<small>[What is a progressive JPEG?](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/what-is-a-progressive-jpeg/) by Liquid Web</small>

Note: hard to tell when an image has actually finished loading. You might even get a bad impression from a website because ‚Äúthe photos look blurry‚Äù (while in fact the site was still loading and you only saw a progressive preview of the photos)

---

## WEBP: Best of both worlds

<img class="plain" src="./images/caniuse-webp.png" alt="caniuse page for webp showing not much safari support">

<small>[caniuse](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webp)</small>

Note: WEBP is a new format available on most modern browsers (I'm looking at you, Safari) that combines the best of JPG and PNG with smaller sizes. It's lossy or lossless and supports transparency.

---

## AVIF: The future

<img class="plain" src="./images/caniuse_avif.png" alt="caniuse page for avif showing limited support">

<small>[Equal file sizes demo](https://jakearchibald.com/2020/avif-has-landed/#at-equal-file-sizes) by Jake Archibald, [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/avif)</small>

- ‚úÖ WEBP: smaller, but need to serve fallbacks <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->

<small>[Responsive Doggos Demo](https://projects.sia.codes/responsive-images-demo/)</small>

Note: Raster file formats are really just different compression methods. **SVG**: Can style and animate with CSS or make basic edits in XML. **GIF**: huge file sizes for animation, use video instead. svg or jpg are better for stills. Twitter converts GIF to video.  **PNG**: Use jpg if don't need transparency. **JPG**: much better compression algos.

# üì∫ Size &amp; Resolution üì∫

---

## Demystifying DPR (device pixel ratio)

On a 2x screen, a displayed image width of 100px needs a 200px file/natural width image to look good.

<img class="plain" src="./images/bantha-resolution.jpeg" alt="Dog in a bantha costume at multiple resolutions from blurry to clear">

Note: n this exaggerated example, the natural width of the bantha doggo on the left is 150px, then 300px, then 600px. The display width is 300px, and my screen has a DPR (device pixel ratio) of 2. 150px is fuzzy. Looking closely, the middle image is not the best quality either.

---

## `srcset`

```html
<img
  srcset="
    https://placekitten.com/300/200 300w,
    https://placekitten.com/600/400 600w
  "
  src="https://placekitten.com/300/200"
  alt="cute random kitten"
/>
```

- States a set of images and the natural size of each image <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Browser assumes a display width of 100vw <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Files are candidates, not commands. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

Note: States a set of images and the natural size of each image. Browser assumes a display width of 100vw. Files are candidates, not commands.. Alternatively, use x-descriptors.

---

## `sizes`

```html
<img
  src="https://placekitten.com/300/200"
  srcset="
    https://placekitten.com/300/200 300w,
    https://placekitten.com/600/400 600w,
    https://placekitten.com/900/500 900w
  "
  sizes="(max-width: 320px) 280px,
         (max-width: 640px) 580px,
         1000px"
  alt="cute random kitten"
/>
```

- States display width for a set of media conditions <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Order matters! First match is used. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- No media condition for the last one (default for no match). <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Add analogous CSS. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

Note: Format is [media condition][space][display width]. Once again, these are candidates, not commands. We are letting the browser choose which file to use ultimately.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="./images/elder-phone.jpg" -->
<h1 style="text-align:right;">ü§î</h1>

Note: How many different resolutions? Science suggests humans can see 720ppi 1 foot from a screen. The iPhone 11 is 326ppi (MBP is 227) so in most cases, you're safe providing only 1x and 2x. You might consider 4x in cases of high-resolution projectors or art.

Note: Furthermore, nowadays most mobile screens are 2x and 3x so we can simplify by not providing 1x options at those screen sizes

---

# üé® Art Direction üé®

<img src="./images/art-direction.png" alt="examples of the same image on multiple devices" style="border:none;box-shadow:none;">

Note: (1) Art direction is a technique for drawing attention to the most important parts, or targeting specific features of an image, even when it‚Äôs viewed on different devices or platforms. (2) So how do we do art direction?

---

## `<picture>`

- Provide multiple images based on device size, resolution, orientation, and more.
- Use `media` attribute for viewport spec. First match is used.
- Always provide `<img>` last for no match or browsers that do not support `<picture>` and `<source>`

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 800px)"
          srcset="wide_800.jpg 800w,
                  wide_1600.jpg 1600w">
  <source media="(min-width: 400px)"
          srcset="narrow_400.jpg 400w,
                  narrow_800.jpg 800w">
  <img src="wide_800.jpg"
       alt="Woman with dog looking at Grand Canyon">
</picture>
```

Note: (1) In this `picture` tag, we have 2 sources and an img. Older browsers simply ignore the picture and source tags and use the img tag. (2) The video tag also works this way and can have multiple `source` tags

---

## Bleeding-Edge File Formats

```html
<picture>
  <source type="image/avif" srcset="pug_life.avif" />
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="pug_life.webp" />
  <img src="pug_life.jpg" alt="pug wearing a striped t-shirt like a boss" />
</picture>
```

- Browser uses the first compatible file type.
- Set `<img>` `src` to a format supported by all browsers.

Note: Browser uses the first compatible file type. Set `<img>` `src` to a format supported by all browsers.

---

## `webp`, `srcset`, &amp; `sizes`, oh my!

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="./images/sofa_pug_400.webp 400w,
                  ./images/sofa_pug_800.webp 800w"
          type="image/webp" />
  <img src="./images/sofa_pug_400.jpg"
        srcset="./images/sofa_pug_400.jpg 400w,
                ./images/sofa_pug_800.jpg 800w"
        sizes="400px"
        width="400px"
        alt="pug on a sofa looking sad" />
</picture>
```

```

## More tools created & more packaged into popular frameworks for DX

- Simple `<img>` and server/serverless function selects best image to serve
- Build tools and integrated frameworks (but `sizes` not always supported)
  - [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image)
  - [responsive-loader](https://github.com/herrstucki/responsive-loader)
  - [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/) and [gatsby-transformer-sharp](https://image-processing.gatsbyjs.org/)
  - [Eleventy image plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/)


Note: (1) Many people have their server hijack the request and serve the best image to minimize markup. Could also use a serverless function. (2) Cost money. (3) So many options - both create your srcset code and process the images

## Image Optimization Toolbox

- Use the right image type (png vs jpg, gif vs video). <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Serve the right size image for the user's screen width and device pixel ratio <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Compress images with a tool like ImageOptim, TinyPNG, SVGOMG, or use a webpack plugin like imagemin-webpack-plugin <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Use newer, improved formats like webp and avif. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Lazy loading, native or with a tool like lazysizes <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

## Preloading self-hosted fonts

```html
<link rel="preload" as="font" type="font/woff2"
  href="./fonts/muli-v12-latin-regular.woff2" crossorigin>

<link rel="preload" as="font" type="font/woff2"
  href="./fonts/muli-v12-latin-700.woff2" crossorigin>
```

<img src="./images/font_preload.png" alt="Self-hosted waterfall showing preload">

<small>Note that `preload` loads a resource whether used or not. Only preload resources that are needed on a particular page, and limit how many you preload.</small>

Note: `rel="preload"` tells the browser to declaratively fetch the resource but not ‚Äúexecute‚Äù it (our CSS will queue usage). `as="font"` tells the browser what it will be downloading so that it can set an appropriate priority. Without it, the browser would set a default low priority. `type="font/woff2` tells the browser the file type so that it only downloads the resource if it supports that file type. `crossorigin` is required because fonts are fetched using anonymous mode CORS.

## More Latency and Caching Strategies

- Use appropriate **caching headers**
- Use **service workers** for precaching and offline optimization
- **Lazy-load** non-critical assets (below-the-fold assets like images, components in JavaScript, etc.)
- Use SVGs instead of icon fonts or subset the font.
- Inline critical CSS with [Critical](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical) and asynchronously load non-critical CSS with [loadCSS](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS).

<small>[Preload, Prefetch And Priorities in Chrome](https://medium.com/reloading/preload-prefetch-and-priorities-in-chrome-776165961bbf) by Addy Osmani</small>

Note: PRPL pattern - push, render, pre-cache, lazy-load

## TL;DR: Ship less code

- less code = less load + less parse/compile
- holy grail = prioritize only what's needed in view

Note: Run a Network profile w/o throttling on one of the following: cnn.com, bbc.com, nytimes.com. Run a Performance profile and check out Summary pane for JS execution time. Click on the Bottom-up pane and group by feature, especially domain and product. Which 3rd-party scripts are the worst offenders? Go back to the Network tab, right-click on one or more of your worst offenders, and select "Block request domain" - edit to use *.domain. Go back to the Performance tab and re-run the profile on reload. Use the timeline sessions list to switch back and forth and compare the results. How can we use this info to improve performance?

## Module Imports

```javascript
// Big = 527kb
import _ from 'lodash';

// Big = 527kb
import {isEmpty} from 'lodash';

// Little = 24kb
import isEmpty from 'lodash/isEmpty';
import { upperCase } from 'lodash-es';

// Big = 544kb
import moment from 'moment';

// Little = 11kb
import addMinutes from 'date-fns/add_minutes';
import { addDays, format } from 'date-fns/fp'
```

<small>Use Moment? Try [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) instead.</small>

Note: Tree-shaking can help do this for us so we don't have to worry so much about doing our imports "correctly".

Note: Paul Lewis coined the term "uncanny valley". Optimizing for content visibility instead of time to interactivity can leave users more frustrated.

Note: PRPL - push minimal code for initial route, render route and get interactive, pre-cache using service workers, and lazy-load async routes. Progressive bootstrapping - Send down a minimally functional page (composed of just the HTML/JS/CSS needed for the current route). As more resources arrive, the app can lazy-load and unlock more features.

## Code Splitting Strategies

1. By **entry point** manually with `entry` config (better combined with #2 to prevent dupes)
2. Prevent duplication and **split chunks** with [SplitChunksPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/)
3. **Dynamic imports** via inline functions that are only imported when needed

<small>[webpack guide on code splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting)</small>

---

## Prefetch chunks while idle

```javascript
import('marked' /* webpackChunkName: "marked", webpackPrefetch: true */)
```

<small>Read more: [`<link rel="prefetch/preload">` in webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/link-rel-prefetch-preload-in-webpack-51a52358f84c) by Tobias Koppers</small>

Note: caveats about the prefetch queue even if suddenly needed now also definitely downloads so don't do too much of this

---

## Optimizing Time to Interactive

- Analyze your loads and bundles! Don't over-optimize! <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Only ship what's immediately needed - use code splitting, pre-caching, and deferred or lazy loading. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Minify to speed up both download and parse/compile. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Compress with gzip or brotli. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Remove unused code with tree shaking or using module imports effectively. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Set up performance budgets to prevent performance creep. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

## Differential Serving, a.k.a. Serve modern code to modern browsers

```html
<!-- Browsers with ES module support load this file. -->
<script type="module" src="main.mjs"></script>

<!-- Older browsers load this file (and module-supporting -->
<!-- browsers know *not* to load this file). -->
<script nomodule src="main.es5.js"></script>
```

      <th>Version</th>
      <th>Size <br />(minified)</th>
      <th>Size <br />(minified + gzipped)</th>

Note: We transpile and polyfill most code, but most users are on modern browsers. So why are we shippping Unnecessary code? What's the impact?  Webpack can create 2 bundles for you - transpiled to ES5 and not-transpiled ES2015+. These are the results from a small blog app - remember since JS is most expensive asset this affects not just download but parse and compile time. <strong>Bigger apps mean bigger gains</strong>. No time to go through how, but this article goes through the steps. (test using script type=module, set up separate webpack config and need to include modules
