Note: - Server wait time, Origin latency time

## HTTP2 Server Push

- ‚úÖ Proactively send resources <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚ùå Caching got more complicated <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚ùå Realizing positive results was hard <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->

---

## 103 Early Hints

- ‚úÖ Only send hints and let the browser decide <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚úÖ Don't make caching harder <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- üßê Results are still early stage <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->

## Preconnect

<img alt="Box plots showing different OS's all with improved LCP performance when Early Hints was used to preconnect to our CDN" class="plain" src="./images/preconnect_LCP.png" width="60%">

Note: BFCM 2021 test. LCP improved across all regions and operating systems on Chrome browsers when an early hint was used to preconnect to our CDN domain. ~500ms improvement in median LCP

# ü§î

Note: take a step back and realize we wouldn't need this if we didn't have a separate CDN domain - so we're using EH to accommodate for a less-than-ideal situation due to legacy architecture - which is totally a valid use case still but something to keep in mind

---

## Preload

```
HTTP/1.1 103 Early Hints
Link: <//cdn.shop.../assets/font1.woff2>; as=font; crossorigin; rel=preload; type=font/woff2
Link: <//cdn.shop.../assets/font3.woff2>; as=font; crossorigin; rel=preload; type=font/woff2
Link: <//cdn.shop.../files/script.js>; as=script; rel=preload; type=text/javascript
Link: <//cdn.shop.../assets/main.js>; as=script; rel=preload; type=text/javascript
Link: <//cdn.shop.../assets/theme.css>; as=style; rel=preload
```

---

## Early Hints via Liquid

```liquid
{{ 'font.woff2'
  | asset_url
  | preload_tag: as: 'font', type: 'font/woff2', crossorigin: true }}

{{ 'script.js' | asset_url | preload_tag: as: 'script' }}

{{ 'style.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag: preload: true }}
```

Note: Stores can only access EH using Liquid, and only to files on our CDN. Will create both preload tags and EH's.

---

```liquid
{{
  product.featured_image
    | image_url: width: 600
    | image_tag: preload: true, widths: 80, 90, 100, 120, 200, 400, 600, 800
}}
```

Note: Can anyone imagine what might go wrong here???

‚ö†Ô∏è Beware of making your headers too large!

Note: where were we? Oh yeah...

<!-- .slide: data-background="./images/rum.jpg", class="filter-dark" -->
# RUM is hard <!-- .element: class="dark-background highlighter"-->

Note: Our preconnect tests were a true A/B test. But for preload, in true engineering style, we might have over optimized the laziness factor and tried to do a before/after test.

<img alt="HTTP Archive Chrome User Experience Report charting TTFB over time for Shopify showing TTFB getting worse in recent months" class="plain" src="./images/crux_shopify_ttfb.png" >

Note: So what we actually measured was a TTFB degradation unrelated to EH. Which leads me to the next part of the presentation...

- ‚úÖ SVG: logos and icons <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚ùå GIF: don't. use jpg for a still or video for animation. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚úÖ PNG: photo-like images with transparency <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->
- ‚úÖ JPG: photo-like images with no transparency <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out no-bullet" -->

<small>[Responsive Doggos Demo](https://projects.sia.codes/responsive-images-demo/)</small>

Note: Raster file formats are really just different compression methods. **SVG**: Can style and animate with CSS or make basic edits in XML. **GIF**: huge file sizes for animation, use video instead. svg or jpg are better for stills. Twitter converts GIF to video. **PNG**: Use jpg if don't need transparency. **JPG**: much better compression algos.
